Thank you for downloading Ozark.  
Ozark is a Roblox™ executor that lets you execute Lua™ Programming Language scripts.

This software requires an active internet connection to function properly.  
Ozark connects to servers to install, fix, or add necessary files.

When first downloading Ozark, you will receive "Ozark Bootstrapper.exe".  
Keep this executable in a folder (preferably the one it came with), as it will install Ozark’s files directly into that folder.

Run the bootstrapper executable to install Ozark.  
If files are removed or corrupted, the bootstrapper may reinstall missing or damaged files.  
If Ozark requires an update, it will automatically launch the bootstrapper which will complete the update process.

Below you can view the VirusTotal scan. This confirms that Ozark is not malicious and is safe.  
These scans have been made without the API in place and only showcase the legitimacy of the Ozark app itself.
